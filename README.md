# Efficiency corrections for factorial moments of overlapping sets of particles


This repository contains a Wolfram Mathematica notebook [**offdiagonal_efficiency_corrections.nb**](offdiagonal_efficiency_corrections.nb) that generates the expressions for efficiency corrected factorial moments of two overlapping sets of particles. An example of such measurements is proton-charge (or kaon-charge) correlations in heavy-ion collisions: all measured protons (or kaons) form a subset of all measured (positive) charges, thus the sets are overlapping.
The efficiency correction is based on the binomial model.
